I am a recent graduate from Carleton College with a B.A. in Computer Science (graduated with Distinction). During my time at Carleton I was part of the Men's Basketball team, Hack4Impact, the Student-Athlete Advisory club, and the Athlete Investment club. I also gained valuable experience as an intern at various organizations and as a prefect/grader for a couple CS classes. 

I am currently looking for full time software engineering roles that start this summer. I have interest and experience in full stack, ML/AI applications, and iOS development.
